## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- 
### Links

- Live Site URL: https://tubular-kashata-22ad55.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- -JavaScript
- API

### What I learned

I just learnt how to use APIs so it was a great practice for me and i'm very proud of myself. I  also successfully used css positioning, i struggle with it most times but i did better this time

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div id="die" class="dice">
    <button>
    </button>
  </div>
```
```css

button{
 position: relative;
 top: 35px;
    padding: 7px;
}
```
```js
let getAdviceButton= document.querySelector("#die");
getAdviceButton.addEventListener("click",getAdvice);
}
```

### Continued development

Its not responsive yet, because i've not fully understood flexbox and responsive design. So i'm going to enroll into a responsive course.
